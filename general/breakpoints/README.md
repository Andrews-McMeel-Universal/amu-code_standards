# Breakpoints

At AMU we support five breakpoints:

1. Extra small <576px
2. Small >=576px (mobile)
3. Medium >=768px (tablet)
4. Large >=992px (desktop)
5. Extra Large >=1200px

We prefer to work from the smallest sizes up, also known as "mobile-first". By starting with most constrained sizes, it helps ensure progressive design and code.
